/*
According to the creation myths of the Abrahamic religions, Adam and Eve were the first Humans to wander the Earth.

You have to do God's job. The creation method must return an array of length 2 containing objects (representing Adam and Eve). The first object in the array should be an instance of the class Man. The second should be an instance of the class Woman. Both objects have to be subclasses of Human. Your job is to implement the Human, Man and Woman classes.
*/



// i should create a function that creates both Man and Woman subclasses of Human, thus i should create Human too
// create empty classes form Human, Man and Woman
class Human {
}
class Man extends Human {}
class Woman extends Human {}

//create() should return and array with the first item being an instance of Man, and the second an instance of Woman
class God{
/**
 * @returns Human[]
 */
  static create(){
    return [new Man(), new Woman()]
  }
}
//execute the function
God.create()
