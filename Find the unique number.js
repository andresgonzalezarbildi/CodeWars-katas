/*

There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55

It’s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

This is the first kata in series:

    Find the unique number (this kata)
    Find the unique string
    Find The Unique

function findUniq(arr) {
  if (arr[0] != arr[1]) {
    for (let i = 2; i < arr.length; i++) {
      if (arr[i] == arr[0]) {
        return arr[1]
      }
    return arr[0]
    }
  } else {
    for (let i = 2; i < arr.length; i++) {
      if (arr[i] != arr[0]) {
        return arr[i]
      }
    }
